# Bookmarker
My first JavaScript project!

Bookmarker is a single page site which allows the user to bookmark urls. 
It utilises local storage, meaning the saved pages persist even on refreshing and closing the page. 
The site is made in vanilla JS, HTML, CSS and  [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling
